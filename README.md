# 🎮 Adventure Game
### *Java 2D Adventure Game Project*

**Adventure Game** is a Java-based 2D game inspired by a YouTube tutorial series 
(see “Video Tutorial Credit” below). The player explores a world, solves puzzles, collects 
items and battles enemies. Assets are used from various creators (see “Credits & Assets” section). 
This project is built as a learning/portfolio piece.
